# Krang

This is a tiny [Etherpad] [etherpad] clone which uses [Markdown] [markdown].  
It has virtually no features. I use it as a personal wiki.


## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adammck/krang.git
cd krang
npm install
node server.js
```


## Usage

* Press escape to toggle between preview and edit mode
* Visit `/whatever` to create a pad named "whatever"
* Use Markdown and/or HTML to write stuff
* Pads are empty by default
